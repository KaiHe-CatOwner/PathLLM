The histological examination reveals a papillary cystadenocarcinoma of the keratinizing type, characterized by invasive and moderately differentiated tumor cells with lymphovascular invasion but no perineural or sanguineous vascular invasion. The primary tumor is surrounded by fatty tissue without evidence of angiolymphatic or sanguineous vascular infiltration at the margin. For further analysis, it is recommended to perform related immunohistochemistry (IHC) tests such as p16, CK5/6, and p63 to confirm squamous differentiation and assess the HPV association.
The specimen consists of two parts: a white-pinkish solid mass within the submandibular glandular region and an ovoid pink-red mucosal tissue sample. Microscopic examination confirms metastasis in the submandibular area and base of the tongue neoplasia consistent with a keratinizing subtype. Given the patient history and the keratinizing subtype identified, relevant immunohistochemistry (IHC) tests that could be recommended include p16 for HPV association, CK5/6 to confirm squamous differentiation, and p63 to support the diagnosis. Clinical information suggests potential exposure to high-risk human papillomavirus types through oral sex contact. For further evaluation, clinical follow-up and additional IHC tests are advised.
Regarding the H&E slide from the lesion center, the microscopic description mentions features typical of squamous cell carcinoma. This includes diffuse thickening of keratins, necrosis, vascular space invasion, and infiltration into surrounding tissues. Based on these observations, recommending IHC tests such as p63 and CK5/6 would be appropriate to confirm squamous differentiation. However, there is no mention of tumor size, location, or specific details from the primary tumor's H&E slide. Given the diagnosis discrepancy, more detailed descriptions from both slides are necessary for further clarification. Additional information about the primary tumor's H&E slide is required for a comprehensive review. It is recommended to conduct a review of prior pathology reports and original slides to resolve the discrepancy. Further evaluation by an experienced pathologist or a pathology quality assurance process is suggested if needed.

What is a possible explanation for the discrepancy between the primary tumor site identified in the pathology report versus that suggested by the digital pathology images?
The discrepancy arises due to the overlapping presence of two malignancies within one specimen. The original pathology report identifies the primary site as the bladder for the urothelial carcinoma, whereas the digital pathology images suggest an overlapping lesion identified as prostatic adenocarcinoma with a Gleason score of 7. The primary site discrepancy might be attributed to the concurrent presence of both urothelial and prostatic malignancies. Given this situation, recommending related IHC tests could provide clarity regarding the dual nature of the diagnosis and help differentiate"
