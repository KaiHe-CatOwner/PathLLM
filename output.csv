Related IHC tests have shown strong positivity for TTF-1 and Napsin A, with focal positivity for CK7. Additional stains, including mucicarmine and PAS, were negative for intr"
"The primary diagnosis is renal cell carcinoma, chromophobe type, originating from the kidney. The specific subtype identified is the eosinophilic variant. The tumor is graded 3 out of 4 according to the Fuhrman classification. The H&E stained WSI from the tumor center shows characteristic features of chromophobe renal cell carcinoma, including large polygonal cells with prominent cell borders and pale cytoplasm. Additionally, focal glomerulosclerosis is noted in the non-neoplastic kidney tissue. For further confirmation, related immunohistochemistry tests such as CD10, c-KIT, CK7, RCC, and vimentin are recommended."," The primary diagnosis is renal cell carcinoma, chromophobe type, originating from the kidney. The specific subtype is the eosinophilic variant. The tumor is nuclear grade 2 and confined to the kidney. On the H&E stained WSI from the tumor center, the carcinoma exhibits characteristic features of chromophobe renal cell carcinoma, including prominent cell borders, perinuclear halos, and a pale, eosinophilic cytoplasm. The nuclei are round and show mild pleomorphism. If immunohistochemistry is required for further clarification, recommended tests include CK7, CD117, and Hale's colloidal iron stain. CK7 and CD117 are positive, while vimentin, RCC, CD10, CD15, and Hale's colloidal iron stain are negative. Electron microscopy findings support the diagnosis. Recommended related IHC tests include CK7, CD117, vimentin, RCC, CD10, CD15,"
"The primary diagnosis is adenocarcinoma with mixed subtypes originating from the colon. The H&E stained WSI from the tumor center reveals features of solid and ductal cell elements, loss of cell nucleus polarity, and increased chromatin image. The tumor shows infiltration into the bordering fatty connective tissue, consistent with a pT3 classification. The cancer is staged as TNM 6th edition Stage grouping ICDO-DA M-8140/3, Grade 2, pT3, pN0, MX, LI, V1, R0. Recommended related IHC tests include markers for epithelial cells (e.g., CK20, CDX2) to confirm the colorectal origin, and mismatch repair proteins (e.g., MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2) to assess for microsatellite instability."," The primary diagnosis is adenocarcinoma originating from the sigmoid colon. The specific subtype identified is moderately differentiated colorectal carcinoma, classified as stage pT2 with vascular invasion (L1) and lymph node involvement (pN1). The tumor infiltrates the muscularis propria and extends into the pericolonic tissues. Histologically on H&E stained slides, the carcinoma shows glandular formations typical of adenocarcinoma with moderate differentiation, characterized by irregular glandular structures infiltrating the stroma. Surrounding the tumor, there is evidence of acute and chronic inflammation with abscess formation. Recommended related immunohistochemistry tests include CK20, CDX2, and MUC2 to confirm colonic origin and further characterize the adenocarcinoma. For further analysis, it may be beneficial to perform IHC tests such as CK7 and CK19 to differentiate from other potential primary sites. Based on the pathology report, a left"
"The primary diagnosis is squamous cell carcinoma originating from the tongue. The specific subtype is invasive moderately differentiated squamous carcinoma with carcinoma in situ. H&E stained WSI from the tumor center shows invasive tumor cells with keratinization and intercellular bridges, characteristic of squamous cell carcinoma. The tumor exhibits features consistent with a moderately differentiated grade. There is also focal mild dysplasia in the squamous mucosa of the glossal mandibular sulcus and squamous metaplasia of the ductal epithelium in the submandibular salivary gland. Recommended related IHC tests include p16, p63, and CK5/6 to support the diagnosis and assess the tumor's behavior."," The H&E stained WSI from the tumor center of the oropharynx reveals a primary diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma. The cancer is moderately differentiated, with invasive characteristics and lymphovascular invasion noted. Extranodal extension is present in the right cervical nodes, while the left cervical nodes are negative for malignancy. Pathological staging is pT3N2bMX. Relevant descriptions from the primary tumor's H&E slide include moderately differentiated squamous cells with evidence of keratinization, intercellular bridges, and invasive growth patterns. Given the squamous cell carcinoma diagnosis, related immunohistochemistry (IHC) tests such as p16, CK5/6, and p63 may be recommended for further characterization. The presence of acute inflammation and focal atelectasis is also observed in the surrounding tissue. For further evaluation, recommending IHC tests for markers such as p16, CK5/6, and p63 could provide"
"The original site of the tumor is the cerebrum. The cancer type is oligodendroglioma, specifically the anaplastic subtype. The tumor is classified as Grade III. Pathological examination of H&E stained whole slide images (WSI) from the tumor center reveals brain tissue consistent with anaplastic oligodendroglioma. The Ki-67 proliferation index is up to 15%. For further characterization, related immunohistochemistry (IHC) tests, such as IDH1, ATRX, and 1p/19q co-deletion status, are recommended."," The primary diagnosis is an anaplastic oligodendroglioma (WHO grade III) located in the cerebrum. Pathological examination reveals a glial neoplasm with diffuse infiltration of both gray and white matter. Tumor cells exhibit round, mildly enlarged nuclei with perinuclear halos, mild to moderate atypia, and up to 6 mitoses per 10 high power fields. No microvascular proliferation or necrosis is identified. The high MIB-1 labeling index of over 25% indicates a highly proliferative neoplasm. Recommend related IHC tests to confirm the diagnosis. For further characterization, immunohistochemistry (IHC) tests such as IDH1 R132H, ATRX, and 1p/19q co-deletion status are recommended. The performing institution does not have these tests available, thus the David J. Gladstone Division's neuropathology lab was consulted for"
